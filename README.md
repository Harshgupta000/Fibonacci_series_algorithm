 ## About Fibonacci series
 The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. This series has applications in various fields like mathematics, computer science, and nature.
 Its verilog code is used to run the implementation on hardware like FPGA.
